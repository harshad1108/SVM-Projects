# 🧑‍💻 Online Exam Cheating Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **cheating behavior during online examinations** using machine learning.  
The goal is to classify exam sessions as **cheating or non-cheating** based on user activity and behavior patterns.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given online exam activity data, predict whether a student is **cheating** or **not cheating** during an exam.

This system is useful for:
- Online proctoring platforms
- EdTech companies
- Academic integrity monitoring

---

## 📊 Dataset
**File:** `online_exam_cheating_detection.csv`

### Sample Features:
- Exam duration  
- Tab switching count  
- Mouse / keyboard activity  
- Webcam or screen focus indicators  

**Target Variable:**
- Cheating (1 → Cheating, 0 → Not Cheating)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🛠 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Scaling  
- SVM Model Training  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results
The SVM model successfully detects cheating behavior with good accuracy, helping maintain fairness in online examinations.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines** can be applied to **EdTech and online proctoring systems** to detect cheating and ensure exam integrity.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Handle class imbalance
- Try different SVM kernels
- Compare with tree-based and ensemble models
