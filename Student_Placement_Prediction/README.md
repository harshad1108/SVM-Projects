# 🎓 Student Placement Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will be **placed in a company** based on academic performance and skill-related attributes.  
Machine learning is used to assist institutions in understanding placement trends and outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given student academic and skill information, predict whether the student will **get placed or not**.

This helps colleges in:
- Placement readiness analysis
- Student performance evaluation
- Career guidance

---

## 📊 Dataset
**File:** `student_p.csv`

### Sample Features:
- CGPA  
- IQ / Aptitude Score  
- Technical Skills  
- Communication Skills  
- Academic Performance  

**Target Variable:**
- Placement Status (Placed / Not Placed)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🛠 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Scaling  
- SVM Model Training  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results
The SVM model successfully predicts student placement outcomes, identifying key academic and skill factors influencing placements.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines** can be applied to **education analytics** and **placement prediction** problems.
