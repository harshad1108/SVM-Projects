# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a **loan application will be approved or rejected** using machine learning.  
The goal is to assist financial institutions in making **data-driven loan approval decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and loan amount, predict the **loan approval status**.

This helps banks in:
- Reducing financial risk
- Automating loan approval processes
- Improving decision accuracy

---

## 📊 Dataset
**File:** `loan_a.csv`

### Sample Features:
- Applicant Income  
- Coapplicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Term  
- Credit History  
- Employment Status  

**Target Variable:**
- Loan Status (Approved / Not Approved)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🛠 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Scaling  
- SVM Model Training  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results
The SVM model effectively predicts loan approval outcomes, identifying key factors that influence lending decisions.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines** can be applied to **financial risk assessment** and **loan approval prediction** problems.
