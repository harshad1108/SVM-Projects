# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent credit card transactions** using machine learning.  
The objective is to classify transactions as **fraudulent or legitimate** to reduce financial loss and improve transaction security.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given transaction-related features, predict whether a credit card transaction is **fraudulent** or **not fraudulent**.

This system is crucial for:
- Banking & financial institutions
- Online payment platforms
- Fraud prevention systems

---

## 📊 Dataset
**File:** `fraud_train.csv`

The dataset contains anonymized transaction features commonly used for fraud detection tasks.

**Target Variable:**
- Fraud Status (1 → Fraud, 0 → Not Fraud)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🛠 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Scaling  
- SVM Model Training  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results
The SVM model effectively detects fraudulent transactions, demonstrating strong performance in identifying suspicious activity.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines** can be applied to **credit card fraud detection**, a critical real-world application in financial security.
