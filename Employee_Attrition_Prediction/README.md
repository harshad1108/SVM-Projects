# 🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **employee attrition** using machine learning.  
The objective is to identify whether an employee is likely to **leave or stay** in the organization based on work, performance, and demographic attributes.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given employee information, predict whether the employee will **attrite (leave)** or **remain** in the company.

This helps organizations with:
- Employee retention strategies
- Workforce planning
- HR decision-making

---

## 📊 Dataset
**File:** `employee_a.csv`

### Sample Features:
- Age  
- Job Role  
- Department  
- Monthly Income  
- Job Satisfaction  
- Years at Company  
- Work-Life Balance  

**Target Variable:**
- Attrition (Yes / No)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🛠 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Scaling  
- SVM Model Training  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results
The SVM model effectively predicts employee attrition, highlighting key factors that influence employee turnover.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines** can be applied to **HR analytics** to predict employee attrition and support data-driven retention strategies.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning (C, kernel selection)
- Compare with Logistic Regression & Tree models
- Handle class imbalance
